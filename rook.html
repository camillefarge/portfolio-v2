            <section class="project_intro">
                <h4>Context</h4>
                <p>I made this project during the "Weekend de Dave". We had <strong>56 hours to build a
                        start-up</strong>
                    with a team of <strong>7 people</strong> (project manager, lawyer, engineer marketers and myself
                    <strong>(visual and interface designer)</strong>)</p>

                <h4>The product</h4>
                <p>Rook is a <strong>coworking service</strong>. We reach companies, particulars or caf√© and offer them
                    an
                    income for their <strong>unused areas</strong>. We provide these empty rooms to <strong>students or
                        startups</strong> looking for places to work.</p>

                <h4>Challenges</h4>
                <p>Rook targets <strong>different type of targets</strong> and each one has various expactations about
                    rook.
                    The brand Identity and the website features had to work for all of these targets.</p>
                <p>We also had to <strong>team up with strangers</strong> in a short amount of time</p>

                <h4>Solution</h4>
                <p>During the UX process, I kept asking myself <strong>"is it efficient for each personas?"</strong>.
                    For
                    instance, I worked a lot on our filters system. The calendar needed to allow user to select a 2
                    hours
                    time slot, but also 2 years.</p>
            </section>



            <section class="project_branding">
                <h2>Branding</h2>
                <img src="assets/img/rook/rook-branding.png" alt="">

                <h3>Define brand</h3>
                <h4>Targets</h4>
                <p>Our customers are looking for the perfect place to work. Some of them want calm and quiet atmosphere
                    in
                    order to work. Others are looking for open spaces towards working in group.</p>
                <p>We have companies looking for a 1 year room just for them. But we also have students looking for a 2
                    hours spot only.</p>
                <p>So there is a wide range of targets but all of them are linked because <strong>they share our
                        values.</strong></p>

                <h4>Values</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>share</li>
                    <li>improve</li>
                    <li>innovate</li>
                    <li>initiate</li>
                    <li>launch</li>
                    <li>go fot it</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Find a name</h4>
                <p>List of words that defines our service :</p>
                <p>place / room / area / find / where</p>
                <p>work / focus / think / study </p>


                <h3>Create a logo</h3>
                <h4>We connect people</h4>
                <p>rook makes the <strong>link between companies</strong> that provides rooms (green O) and
                    <strong>customers</strong> looking for places to work (blue O). This graphic also stands for
                    </strong>teamwork</strong> : a large part of our audience will use our rooms to work as a group</p>
                <p class="strong">This relation is symbolised by the two circles</p>

                    <figcaption>Faded green O and vibrant blue O</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h4>Grow your projects</h4>
                <p><strong>Fully lowercase</strong> (rook and not Rook) was a better solution for us because :</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>easy to read</li>
                    <li>visually better lines</li>
                    <li>growth / improve</li>
                    <li>increase vs hectic</li>
