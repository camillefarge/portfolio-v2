                    <h4>Context</h4>
                    <p>I made this project during the "Weekend de Dave". We had <strong>56 hours to build a
                            start-up</strong>
                        with a team of <strong>7 people</strong> (project manager, lawyer, engineer marketers and myself
                        <strong>(visual and interface designer)</strong>)</p>
                </div>

                <div class="project_text-wrapper">
                    <h4>The product</h4>
                    <p>Rook is a <strong>coworking service</strong>. We reach companies, particulars or caf√© and offer
                        them
                        an
                        income for their <strong>unused areas</strong>. We provide these empty rooms to <strong>students
                            or
                            startups</strong> looking for places to work.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="project_text-wrapper">
                    <h4>Challenges</h4>
                    <p>Rook targets <strong>different type of targets</strong> and each one has various expactations
                        about
                        rook.
                        The brand Identity and the website features had to work for all of these targets.</p>
                    <p>We also had to <strong>team up with strangers</strong> in a short amount of time</p>
                </div>
                <div class="project_text-wrapper">
                    <h4>Solution</h4>
                    <p>During the UX process, I kept asking myself <strong>"is it efficient for each
                            personas?"</strong>.
                        For
                        instance, I worked a lot on our filters system. The calendar needed to allow user to select a 2
                        hours
                        time slot, but also 2 years.</p>
